# Spiff Sans

A font originally designed [to fill in for OpenSCAD's lack of proper text facilities](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13347), this low-poly geometric font has been revived as a proper TrueType /  OpenType font, for use with any modeling program that can handle outline fonts (like modern versions of OpenSCAD, via `text()`).
